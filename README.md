# ft_transcendence

ft_transcendence is the last project of the 42CommonCore.

## What is it about ?

As it is the last project, its goal is to make us learn and be accostumed to the latest web tech on the market.

The subject states that we must create a single-page application that allows users to authentificate using the 42auth (school API) and to play pong (1972) against each other.
They can also communicate, either through dms or public/password-protected channels.
They also have access to an account page where they can change their name or avatar, enable or disable 2FA and see their game history.

## How to launch it ?

After dl the repo `git clone https://github.com/blaneart/transcendence`
You can simply run `docker-compose up --build` in the folder downloaded and ... wait up to 10 minutes (this is a fullstack js project what did you expect ?).

## A few scrrenshots of the final product

Please note that we did not spend as much time on front as we did on backend/functionnalities
